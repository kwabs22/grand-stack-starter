To Learn a pattern that already exist requires repitition of the shape of the pattern 

aka to practice you have gut the metaphorical fish ==> existing code must be reverse engineered into syntax structures to fully understand the flow of data with it

eg. in VS code all declared variables can be one colour while all arguments passed get another colour 
==> those are the things that need to be removed to study the structure of the code ==> Reverse engineer a syntax highlighter

One approach to Brainstorming a coding problem is using the wrong code structure at random until you understand what the right one is
